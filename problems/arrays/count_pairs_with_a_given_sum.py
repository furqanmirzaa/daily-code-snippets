        # Problem: Group Anagrams
        # Category: Array, Hash Table, String, Sorting
        # Difficulty: Medium
        # Description: Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together.
        # You can return the answer in any order. An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging
        # the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

        # --- Skeleton Code ---
        # This method will take a list of strings and return a list of lists of strings,
        # where each inner list contains anagrams of each other.
