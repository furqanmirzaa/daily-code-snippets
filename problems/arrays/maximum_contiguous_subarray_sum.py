        Problem: Unique Paths
        Category: Dynamic Programming
        Difficulty: Medium

        A robot is located at the top-left corner of an m x n grid (grid[0][0]).
        The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.
        The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (grid[m-1][n-1]).
        How many possible unique paths are there?

        Example 1:
        Input: m = 3, n = 7
        Output: 28

        Example 2:
        Input: m = 3, n = 2
        Output: 3
        Explanation:
        From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
        1. Right -> Down -> Down
        2. Down -> Down -> Right
        3. Down -> Right -> Down

        Constraints:
        1 <= m, n <= 100
        It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10^9.
